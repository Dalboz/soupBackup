by [Błażej Wolańczyk](https://github.com/Junikorn)


CMD tool for backing up available soup.io assets taken from soup RSS feed.
You can find RSS feed on soup.io in options > privacy > export (RSS).
If the RSS file won't download at first time (e.g. showing 504 Gateway Timeout) please retry

How to run:
 - install [node.js](http://nodejs.org) at least at version 4.4.3
 - open CMD/bash in this directory (on Windows: Shift + Right Click > Open Command Line Here)
 - write in command "node backup"
 - [optionally] after space write in file name if it is different from "soup.rss" (or rename your file)
 - [optionally] after space write in number of simultaneous downloads
     (default is 20, please keep it within reason, your bandwidth, file system and processor are the limit)
